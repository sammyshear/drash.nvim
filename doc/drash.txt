A Neovim plugin for helping to write a Drash/D’var Torah without leaving
Neovim. It relies on the Sefaria API to provide info on the Parsha and any
supporting texts you might need.


INSTALLATION                                   *drash-drash.nvim-installation*

>lua
    {
      "sammyshear/drash.nvim",
      dependencies = {

USAGE                                                 *drash-drash.nvim-usage*

The plugin provides a command `Parsha` which will open the Parsha for the week
and give you a buffer user command `Commentaries` which will allow you to
telescope pick between commentaries on the Parsha.

The plugin also provides the `SearchSefaria` command which allows you to make
use of the Sefaria ElasticSearch API to search any texts on the website for
arbitrary queries. The command takes an argument that is your search query and
opens a telescope picker to allow you to select the text you want to see.


DEVELOPMENT                                     *drash-drash.nvim-development*


FORMAT ~

The CI uses `stylua` to format the code; customize the formatting by editing
`.stylua.toml`.


TEST ~

Uses busted <https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/> for testing. Install by
using `luarocks --lua-version=5.1 install busted` then run `busted` for your
test cases.

Create test cases in the `spec` directory. Busted expects files in this
directory to be named `foo_spec.lua`, with `_spec` as a suffix before the
`.lua` file extension. For more usage details please check busted usage
<https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/>


CI ~

- Auto generates doc from README.
- Runs the Busted integration tests
- Lints with `stylua`.
